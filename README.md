# DeepSeek Engineer üêã

## Overview

DeepSeek Engineer is a powerful AI-powered coding assistant that provides an interactive terminal interface for seamless code development. It integrates with DeepSeek's advanced reasoning models to offer intelligent file operations, code analysis, and development assistance through natural conversation and function calling.

## üöÄ Latest Update: Function Calling Architecture

**Version 2.0** introduces a revolutionary upgrade from structured JSON output to native function calling, providing:
- **Natural conversations** with the AI without rigid response formats
- **Automatic file operations** through intelligent function calls
- **Real-time reasoning visibility** with Chain of Thought (CoT) capabilities
- **Enhanced reliability** and better error handling

## Key Features

### üß† **AI Capabilities**
- **Elite Software Engineering**: Decades of experience across all programming domains
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Visible thought process before providing solutions
- **Code Analysis & Discussion**: Expert-level insights and optimization suggestions
- **Intelligent Problem Solving**: Automatic file reading and context understanding

### üõ†Ô∏è **Function Calling Tools**
The AI can automatically execute these operations:

#### `read_file(file_path: str)`
- Read single file content with automatic path normalization
- Built-in error handling for missing or inaccessible files

#### `read_multiple_files(file_paths: List[str])`
- Batch read multiple files efficiently
- Formatted output with clear file separators

#### `create_file(file_path: str, content: str)`
- Create new files or overwrite existing ones
- Automatic directory creation and safety checks
- No manual confirmation required

#### `create_multiple_files(files: List[Dict])`
- Create multiple files in a single operation
- Perfect for scaffolding projects or creating related files

#### `edit_file(file_path: str, original_snippet: str, new_snippet: str)`
- Precise snippet-based file editing
- Visual diff preview with user confirmation
- Safe replacement with exact matching

### üìÅ **Manual File Operations**
- **`/add path/to/file`** - Include single file in conversation context
- **`/add path/to/folder`** - Include entire directory (with smart filtering)
- **Automatic context management** - Files remain available throughout the session

### üé® **Rich Terminal Interface**
- **Color-coded feedback** (green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- **Real-time streaming** with visible reasoning process
- **Structured tables** for diff previews
- **Progress indicators** for long operations

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Safety**
- **Path normalization** and validation
- **Directory traversal protection**
- **File size limits** (5MB per file)
- **Binary file detection** and exclusion
- **User confirmation** for destructive operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **DeepSeek API Key**: Get your API key from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. **Python 3.11+**: Required for optimal performance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deepseek-engineer
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (choose one method):

   #### Using uv (recommended - faster)
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv run r1.py
   ```

   #### Using pip
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 r1.py
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### **Natural Conversation with File Operations**
```
You> Can you read the main.py file and create a test file for it?

Thinking...
Reasoning: I need to first read the main.py file to understand its structure...

Assistant> I'll read the main.py file first to understand its structure.
‚Üí read_file("main.py")
‚úì Read file 'main.py'

Now I'll create comprehensive tests based on the code structure I found.
‚Üí create_file("test_main.py", content="import unittest...")
‚úì Created file 'test_main.py'

I've analyzed main.py and created comprehensive tests covering all the main functions...
```

#### **Code Analysis and Improvements**
```
You> /add src/

‚úì Added folder 'src/' to conversation.
Added files: (15 files)
  src/utils.py
  src/models.py
  ...

You> Can you review this codebase and suggest improvements?

Thinking...
Reasoning: I'll analyze the codebase structure, looking for patterns, potential issues...

Assistant> I've reviewed your codebase and found several areas for improvement:

1. **Error Handling**: The utils.py file could benefit from more robust error handling...
‚Üí edit_file("src/utils.py", original_snippet="def process_data(data):", new_snippet="def process_data(data):\n    if not data:\n        raise ValueError('Data cannot be empty')")

Would you like me to apply this improvement?
```
